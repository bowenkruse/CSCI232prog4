# CSCI232prog4

This is the fourth and final programming assignment for CSCI 232. Inside is the java 
implementations of both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm.

There are two seperate classes, one for implementing Kruskals algorithm and one for implementing Prim's.
In order to run these, both input files, AdjacencyList.txt and matrix.txt must be within the source folder
as they should be now. 

Output of both classes go to their own separete files.

Both programs are based on examples found in "Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne"
at pages 616-622 (Prims) and 624-627 (Kruskals) or at https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst/
